# Transport

In order to execute choreographies, we need to be able to send messages between locations. ChoRus provides a trait `Transport` that abstracts over message transports.

## Built-in Transports

ChoRus provides two built-in transports: `local` and `http`.

### The Local Transport

The `local` transport is used to execute choreographies on the same machine on different threads. This is useful for testing and prototyping.

To use the local transport, we first need to create a `LocalTransportChannel`, which works as a channel between threads and allows them to send messages to each other. To do so, we use the `LocalTransportChannelBuilder` struct from the `chorus_lib` crate.

```rust
# extern crate chorus_lib;
# use chorus_lib::core::{ChoreographyLocation, LocationSet};
# #[derive(ChoreographyLocation)]
# struct Alice;
# #[derive(ChoreographyLocation)]
# struct Bob;
use chorus_lib::transport::local::LocalTransportChannelBuilder;

let transport_channel = LocalTransportChannelBuilder::new()
    .with(Alice)
    .with(Bob)
    .build();
```

Using the `with` method, we add locations to the channel. When we call `build`, it will create an instance of `LocalTransportChannel`.

Then, create a transport by using the `LocalTransport::new` function, which takes a target location (explained in the [Projector section](./guide-projector.md)) and the `LocalTransportChannel`.

```rust
# extern crate chorus_lib;
# use chorus_lib::core::{ChoreographyLocation, LocationSet};
# #[derive(ChoreographyLocation)]
# struct Alice;
# use chorus_lib::transport::local::LocalTransportChannelBuilder;
# let transport_channel = LocalTransportChannelBuilder::new().with(Alice).build();
use chorus_lib::transport::local::{LocalTransport};

let alice_transport = LocalTransport::new(Alice, transport_channel.clone());
```

Because of the nature of the `Local` transport, you must use the same `LocalTransportChannel` instance for all locations. You can `clone` the `LocalTransportChannel` instance and pass it to each `Projector::new` constructor.

```rust
# extern crate chorus_lib;
# use chorus_lib::transport::local::{LocalTransport, LocalTransportChannelBuilder};
# use std::thread;
# use chorus_lib::core::{ChoreographyLocation, ChoreoOp, Choreography, Projector, LocationSet};
# #[derive(ChoreographyLocation)]
# struct Alice;
# #[derive(ChoreographyLocation)]
# struct Bob;
# struct HelloWorldChoreography;
# impl Choreography for HelloWorldChoreography {
#     type L = LocationSet!(Alice, Bob);
#     fn run(self, op: &impl ChoreoOp<Self::L>) {
#     }
# }
let transport_channel = LocalTransportChannelBuilder::new()
    .with(Alice)
    .with(Bob)
    .build();
let mut handles: Vec<thread::JoinHandle<()>> = Vec::new();
{
    // create a transport for Alice
    let transport = LocalTransport::new(Alice, transport_channel.clone());
    handles.push(thread::spawn(move || {
        let p = Projector::new(Alice, transport);
        p.epp_and_run(HelloWorldChoreography);
    }));
}
{
    // create another for Bob
    let transport = LocalTransport::new(Bob, transport_channel.clone());
    handles.push(thread::spawn(move || {
        let p = Projector::new(Bob, transport);
        p.epp_and_run(HelloWorldChoreography);
    }));
}
```

### The HTTP Transport

The `http` transport is used to execute choreographies on different machines. This is useful for executing choreographies in a distributed system.

To use the `http` transport, import `HttpTransport` and `HttpTransportConfigBuilder` from the `chorus_lib` crate.

```rust
# extern crate chorus_lib;
use chorus_lib::transport::http::{HttpTransport, HttpTransportConfigBuilder};
```

We need to construct a `HttpTransportConfig` using the `HttpTransportConfigBuilder`. First, we specify the target location and the hostname and port to listen on using the `for_target` method. Then, we specify the other locations and their `(hostname, port)` pairs using the `with` method.

```rust
{{#include ./header.txt}}
# use chorus_lib::transport::http::{HttpTransport, HttpTransportConfigBuilder};
// `Alice` listens on port 8080 on localhost
let config = HttpTransportConfigBuilder::for_target(Alice, ("localhost", 8080))
                // Connect to `Bob` on port 8081 on localhost
                .with(Bob, ("localhost", 8081))
                .build();
let transport = HttpTransport::new(config);
```

In the above example, the transport will start the HTTP server on port 8080 on localhost. If Alice needs to send a message to Bob, it will use `http://localhost:8081` as the destination.

## Creating a Custom Transport

You can also create your own transport by implementing the `Transport` trait. It might be helpful to first build a `TransportConfig` to have the the information that you need for each `ChoreographyLocation`, and then have a constructor that takes the `TransportConfig` and builds the `Transport` based on it. While the syntax is similar to `HttpTransportConfig`, which is `HttpTransportConfigBuilder::for_target(target_location, target_information)`, chained with information about other locations using the `.with(other_location, other_location_information)`, the type of information for each `ChoreographyLocation` might diverge from the `(host_name, port)` format presented in `HttpTransport`. In some cases, the `target_information` could even have a different type than the following `other_location_information` types. But all the `other_location_information`s should have the same type.

```rust
{{#include ./header.txt}}
# use chorus_lib::transport::TransportConfigBuilder;
let config = TransportConfigBuilder::for_target(Alice, ())
                .with(Bob, ("localhost", 8081))
                .with(Carol, ("localhost", 8082))
                .build();
```

See the API documentation for more details.

### Note on the location set of the Choreography

Note that when calling `epp_and_run` on a `Projector`, you will get a compile error if the location set of the `Choreography` is not a subset of the location set of the `Transport`. In other words, the `Transport` should have information about every `ChoreographyLocation` that `Choreography` can talk about. So this will fail:

```rust, compile_fail
# extern crate chorus_lib;
# use chorus_lib::transport::local::{LocalTransport, LocalTransportChannelBuilder};
# use chorus_lib::core::{ChoreographyLocation, Projector, Choreography, ChoreoOp, LocationSet};

# #[derive(ChoreographyLocation)]
# struct Alice;
# #[derive(ChoreographyLocation)]
# struct Bob;
struct HelloWorldChoreography;
impl Choreography for HelloWorldChoreography {
     type L = LocationSet!(Alice, Bob);
     fn run(self, op: &impl ChoreoOp<Self::L>) {
     }
}

let transport_channel = LocalTransportChannelBuilder::new().with(Alice).build();
let transport = LocalTransport::new(Alice, transport_channel.clone());
let projector = Projector::new(Alice, transport);
projector.epp_and_run(HelloWorldChoreography);
```
